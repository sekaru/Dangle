# Dangle

Dangle is a tool for finding and scheduling other players for smaller multiplayer games. Choose when and how long you'll be online for others to see and schedule their own sessions around.

## Beta

The current version lacks a few features I'd like to implement from small things like adding a note to a session to larger things like suggesting edits and updates to games, etc. 

I wanted to get something out there before the end of the current Ludum Dare which was the main inspiration for this. I'll probably be posting development updates on my twitter, [@sekaru_](http://twitter.com/sekaru_) or you can have a look at the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md).
